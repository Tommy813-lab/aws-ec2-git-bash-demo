# AWS Infrastructure Architecture

This project sets up the core AWS infrastructure for monitoring and storage:

- **EC2**: Hosts application servers.
- **S3**: Stores static assets and logs.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors EC2 metrics and collects logs for analysis.

The architecture ensures scalability and reliability with real-time alerts.
