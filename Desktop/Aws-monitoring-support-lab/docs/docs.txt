# AWS Monitor Support Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates a manual deployment of an AWS monitoring setup using EC2 and CloudWatch. It covers creating an IAM role, launching an EC2 instance with monitoring enabled, installing the CloudWatch Agent, and setting up alarms and dashboards.

---

## Features
- EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 with CloudWatch Agent
- IAM Role with `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` attached
- CloudWatch alarms on key metrics such as CPU utilization
- Custom dashboards for real-time monitoring visualization
- Step-by-step manual deployment instructions

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with permissions to manage EC2, IAM, and CloudWatch
- Access to AWS Console or AWS CLI
- Basic knowledge of AWS services

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create IAM Role
- Create IAM role trusted by EC2 service
- Attach AWS managed policy `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`
- Name the role (e.g., `EC2_CloudWatch_Monitoring_Role`)

### 2. Launch EC2 Instance
- Use Amazon Linux 2 AMI
- Assign the IAM role created above
- Configure security group to allow SSH access

### 3. Install CloudWatch Agent
- SSH into the EC2 instance
- Install agent with:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
Configure and start the agent with your JSON configuration

4. Configure CloudWatch Alarms & Dashboards
Create alarms on metrics like CPUUtilization

Set up dashboards for monitoring

Usage
Connect to EC2 via SSH for agent management

Monitor metrics and alarms in AWS CloudWatch Console

Use dashboards for visual insights

Troubleshooting
Ensure IAM role is attached correctly to EC2

Check agent status:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -m ec2 -a status
Review logs at /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/
